<h1 align="center">Calculator</h1>

I was tasked to create a Calculator in my class, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Wu. I am taking this Udemy class on the side of my official coursework at Western Governors University. This is day ten of the class. This is a semi work along project. Basically challenged to complete a step then a review of the step with the teacher.

<h2>I was to focus on using the following concepts that I learned today.</h2>

-Functions with outputs

-Returning multiple values

-Combining functions with dictionaries

-Docstrings

<h2>What I learned</h2>
Docstrings seem extremely helpful for a user coming back to a project or when working in groups. I love using comments so this will further help me. I was aware of returning values in a function but was not comfortable with the complete logic of it. I feel a lot better with it now and see it's value. Everyday it is nice to see how the previous lessons combined with today's lessons expanding the capabilites of python so much. Loops went so much better today, starting to click.

<h2>Issues I had and where I can do better.</h2>
Today was honestly a good day. Things went fairly smoothly. I didn't add any type check today but I am okay with it.
